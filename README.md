This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website built using Sanity CMS, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. The website serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experiences.

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project is a single-page application built using the Sanity CMS for content management, Next.js for server-side rendering, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences, allowing potential employers and collaborators to learn more about me and my work.
